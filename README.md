- Start with the class Player, which has two properties: name, a string and jersey, a number, both set by the constructor

- Create a subclass of Player called BasketBallPlayer, which has an additional property called slamDunks, a number, set by the constructor and defaults to 0.

- Create a subclass of Player called BaseBallPlayer, which has an additional property called homeRuns, a number, set by the constructor and defaults to 0.

- Implement a method on BasketBallPlayer called increaseSlamDunks which increases the slamDunk property by one every time it is called

- Implement a method called outOfThePark which increases the homeRuns property by however many players ran to home base, provided as an argument
